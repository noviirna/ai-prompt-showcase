## Summary

This portfolio documents my journey into the exciting field of AI Prompt Engineering. As I transition from a background in software engineering, tech leadership, and solution architecture, I am actively learning and experimenting with various prompt engineering techniques and exploring the capabilities of large language models. This repository serves as a collection of my learning exercises, experiments, and early projects as I develop my skills in crafting effective AI prompts for applications such as creative writing, information retrieval, & code generation. For complete portofolios you can see my [Notion](https://www.notion.so/1f371191df7f8010af12dd8441dc98a7?v=1f371191df7f80ae9c6e000c29ae5bea&pvs=4) pages. 

## Learning Goals

My current learning goals in AI Prompt Engineering include:

* Understanding the fundamentals of different prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, etc.).
* Gaining practical experience with Amazon PartyRocks, OpenAI's Playground, ChatGPT, Gemini, Dall-E etc.
* Exploring prompt optimization strategies to improve the quality and relevance of AI outputs.
* Learning how to apply prompt engineering to solve specific problems in health, medical.
* Documenting my learning process and sharing my insights.

## Skills (Developing)

* **Prompting Fundamentals:** Exposure to zero-shot, few-shot prompting.
* **Large Language Models:** Currently learning to work with GPT Series (OpenAI), Claude, Gemini.
* **Problem-Solving:** Applying analytical skills from my software background to understand and refine prompts.
* **Documentation:** Committed to documenting my learning process and findings.

## Experience (Transferable Skills)

My background in software engineering, tech leadership, and solution architecture provides a valuable foundation for learning AI Prompt Engineering, which consists of:

* Solution Architect at PT BANK CIMB NIAGA TBK
* Tech Lead at PT BANK CIMB NIAGA TBK
* Software Engineer at PT BANK CIMB NIAGA TBK

Those experience has provided me with a strong foundation in:

* **Analytical and Problem-Solving Skills:** Extensive experience in software engineering, IT analysis, and solution architecture has honed ability to analyze complex problems, identify root causes, and devise effective solutions. This is crucial for crafting prompts that elicit desired outputs from LLMs.
* **Technical Proficiency:** Experienced in Java, Spring Boot, React, React Native, Vue.js, and other technologies demonstrates a strong understanding of software development principles and the ability to work with complex systems. This knowledge can be valuable in understanding how LLMs process and interpret prompts.
* **Experience with Agile and DevSecOps:** Familiarity with iterative development processes, continuous improvement, and the importance of security from previous experiences working with Agile methodologies and DevSecOps practices. These skills helps to effectively manage prompt engineering workflows and ensure the responsible and secure use of LLMs.
* **Communication and Collaboration:** Consistently collaborated with cross-functional teams, including product managers, designers, and developers. This experience in communicating technical concepts clearly and concisely, and working effectively with others, is essential for prompt engineering, which often involves iterative refinement and collaboration.
* **Understanding of User Needs:** My previous work on digital banking applications has given me a deep understanding of user needs and how technology can be used to enhance user experiences. This user-centric perspective is valuable in prompt engineering, where the goal is to create prompts that generate useful and relevant outputs for users.
* **Adaptability and Learning Agility:** My career progression and experience in migrating to new technologies demonstrate your ability to adapt to changing environments and learn new skills quickly. This is crucial in the rapidly evolving field of AI, where new LLMs and prompting techniques are constantly emerging.

## Career Pivot to AI Prompt Engineering (Learning Phase)

I am actively pursuing a career transition into AI Prompt Engineering and am dedicated to building the necessary skills and experience. This portfolio reflects my commitment to learning and my progress in understanding how to effectively interact with AI models through well-crafted prompts. I am eager to contribute my growing knowledge and unique perspective to a team focused on leveraging the power of AI.

## Experiments and Early Projects

This section showcases my initial explorations and projects as I learn AI prompting. These may be simple experiments or attempts to apply learned techniques.

### Learning 1: [Exploring Amazon PartyRocks: Content Generation]
* **Date:** 14th May 2025, Wed.
* **Description:** My first attempt at learning content creation using AI on Amazon PartyRock.
* **Prompt:** The prompts I used are in the demo link. 
* **Output:** The output from the prompts are in the demo link.
* **Learnings:** Basic of write prompts to generate content. Use cases include: Brainstorming, Outlining, First draft. I learn about how to communicate user needs into the LLM so it can generate optimal answer without having to ask more number of questions.
